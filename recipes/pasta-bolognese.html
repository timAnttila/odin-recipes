    <h2>Delicious pasta bolognese</h2>
    <p>On a hectic weeknight, nothing beats the convenience of a one-pot meal.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, diced</li>
        <li>1 celery stalk, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped pancetta</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 sprig thyme</li>
        <li>¾ cup white wine</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or beef stock</li>
        <li>1 28-ounce can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 piece of parmesan rind</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 16-ounce package pappardelle or tagliatelle pasta noodles</li>
        <li>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil, for garnish</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>How to</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select the sauté function. Heat oil in the pot; add ground beef and season with salt and pepper, and stir to cook until browned and crumbly (5 to 7 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add onion, carrot, celery, garlic, and pancetta and stir, sautéing until the veggies are soft (8-10 minutes). Add tomato paste, bay leaf, thyme sprig, and white wine. Stir it all together, and allow the sauce to bubble and the alcohol to cook off for a minute or two.</li>
        <li>Add stock and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, heavy cream, and parmesan rind and stir until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Turn the appliance off sauté mode, then close and lock the lid. Select low pressure and set the timer for 4 minutes, allowing 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. When the timer is up, release the pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to the manufacturer's instructions, which will take about 5 minutes. Then, unlock and remove the lid.</li>
        <li>Turn the appliance back to sauté mode, add in the noodles, and stir them into the sauce, making sure they are fully submerged. Cook the noodles for about 5 minutes, or until they reach al dente (note: it will be about half the time as stated on the box).</li>
        <li>Once the noodles are cooked, plate up a portion with a hefty helping of grated parmesan cheese, some torn basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil, and enjoy.</li>
